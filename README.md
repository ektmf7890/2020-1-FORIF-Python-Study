### Hackathon Result
5 members of our mentoring group([Dayoung Yun](), 진규리, 조다희, 김서영, 현규원) participated in the 2020 Forif Hackathon. Check this [link](https://github.com/orgs/hforif/repositories) to see all the hackathon results from Forif throughout the years!

Our team decided to take on a project where we can apply the fundamental programming concepts we learned this semester, such as data types, control statements, functions and even a smattering of OOP. Also, we studied how to develop simple desktop GUI applications using [PyQt](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)!   

Our project is to create a scheduler app that has an entertainment factor as well. The user can create tasks that must be done that day using the interface shown below. Users can designate a date, time, category, and even a difficulty for each task. Let's add a 100 squat task under the category '운동(excercise)', with difficulty of 3.

Do the squats, and check the task off the list. Then you will see that your 'Excerise Cat' has gained 30xp due to this task. A cute way to motivate yourself to workout! :)

I think it was a great project to enhance the programming skills we learned through this mentoring group and also the team effort was amazing. The code for our project can be found [here](https://github.com/ektmf7890/2020-1-FORIF-Hackathon)!
