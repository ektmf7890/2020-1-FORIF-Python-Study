### Hackathon Result
At the 2020 summer Hackathon held by Forif, our mentorship gourp participated as a team and completed a scheduler desktop applicaiton in PyQt.   

It is the combined result of 5 members from our group, [Dayoung Yun](), 진규리, 조다희, 김서영, 현규원.    

We used all the knowledge we mastered througout the semester, including fundamental programming concepts and Qt in Python.
